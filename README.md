### 📚 What was implemented by me:

- An interesting button was implemented on hovering over which the text appears

### 🐍 My comments on this work:

🔸 I want to note right away that I liked this work because all the pictures were in `svg` format (rarely when designers do this)  
🔸 But most of all, what pleased me was the fact that the line spacing was normally calculated by the designer (designers usually do not know about font metrics)  
🔸 Also from the interesting I can note the calculator, which is located between the two sections
